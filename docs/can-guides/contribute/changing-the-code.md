##  Make your changes

Once you’ve figured out where you need to make changes, you’ll want to complete the following steps
to make those changes and create a pull request so we can include your code in future releases:


1. Create a new feature branch. For example, `git checkout -b html5-fix`.
2. Make some changes to the code and tests.
4. Run `npm test` to make sure the tests pass in all browsers.
5. Update the documentation if necessary.
6. Push your changes to your remote branch.  For example, `git push origin html5-fix`.
7. Submit a pull request! On GitHub, navigate to Pull Requests and click the “New Pull Request” button. Fill in some
   details about your potential patch, including a meaningful title. When finished, press “Send pull request”. The core team will be notified of your submission and will let you know of any problems or a targeted release date.

If you enjoy making these kinds of fixes and want to directly influence CanJS’s direction,
consider joining our [Core team](https://donejs.com/About.html#core-team).
